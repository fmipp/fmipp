 * \mainpage The FMI++ Library: A High-level Utility Package for the Functional Mock-Up Interface Specification
 *
 *
 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * The FMI specification intentionally provides only the most
 * essential and fundamental functionalities in the form of a C
 * interface. On the one hand, this increases flexibility in use and
 * portability to virtually any platform. On the other hand, such a
 * low-level approach implies several prerequisites a simulation tool
 * has to fulfil in order to be able to utilize such an FMI component.
 *
 * The FMI++ library addresses this problem for models according to the
 * FMI specification by providing high-level functionalities, which ease
 * the handling and manipulation of such models. Furthermore, the FMI++
 * library provides utilities to implement FMI-conformant interfaces for
 * a large class of simulation tools.
 *
 * The FMI++ library intends to bridge the gap between the basic FMI
 * specifications and the typical requirements of simulation tools.
 * It is distributed using a BSD-like license and suggestions or contributions are heartly welcome.
 *
 *
 * \section install_sec Installation
 *
 * A guide for instaling FMI++ can be found @link http://sourceforge.net/p/fmipp/wiki/Home/ online @endlink.
