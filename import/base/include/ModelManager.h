/**
 * \file ModelManager.h
 * \class ModelManager provides the basic routines with which FMU models are managed.
 * 
 * An instance of ModelManager preserves basic info about the used FMUs, their paths, model names, provided 
 * shared libraries (DLL) and the XML description file. The underlying DLLs are dynamically loaded and the XML files
 * get parsed. It provides a portable implementation regardless of the platform that has been used for generating 
 * the employed FMUs. An instance of model manager:
 * 1. is privately constructed and cannot be externally instantiated 
 * 2. provides FMI functions of any FMU given (FMUs have to be already unzipped)
 * 3. loads FMUs only once, which is very time-saving in case several instances of the same FMU are used
